### This app consists of a front-end deployed on Vercel, the back-end is the API that gives the front-end all the information to display. It is deployed on heroku along with the postgreSQL database. I used sequelize to connect both.<br>
### It has a controlled form to create your own dog, it uses reg expressions, no form library used. It is validated in the database as well. It lets you choose 3 temperaments from all the available ones. <br>
### the front-end displays the number of pages dinamically based on the number of dogs found that met the requirements set by the user. It also has buttons to navigate through the pages, when you reach the end or the beginning they get disabled so you cannot go further. <br>
### The filters offered are a combination of back-end and front-end functions as well as queries to the database via Sequelize. No external API filters are applied.
